# Water-Access-Quality-and-Infrastructure-Analysis
This project focuses on cleaning data stored in a MySQL server and then analysing that data to gain insights into the reality on ground.
The aim of this project is to determine the level of water access in a particular region and determine ways to improve basic access to water supply among inhabitants.
This information would be passed on to key stakeholders for decision-making.
