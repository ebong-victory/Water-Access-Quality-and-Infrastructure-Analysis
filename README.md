# Water-Access-Quality-and-Infrastructure-Analysis
This project focuses on cleaning collected data and analysing it to gather adequate insight into the reality on ground using MySQL. 
It also encompasses further data cleaning and analysis with MS Power BI.
Finally, it covers reporting the findings from the analysis using dashboards built with Power BI.
The information gained from this is passed on to key stakeholders to aid them in understanding the current situation 
as relating to water access and help them make data-driven decisions that would yield expected results.
